# Network pulse

This a prototype to test a few ideas on how to gather a stream of things created by a network of people and organizations. The goals: keep friction low to maximize input; optimize signal and noise to surface interesting projects. The theory: do this well and more instances of collaboration and innovation will emerge from the network.
